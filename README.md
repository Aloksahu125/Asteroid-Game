# Asteroid-Game
This game is a inspired version of *'_Astroids_'*, an arcade game published by Atari. After learning about the properties and physics of key components of the game (Ship, Asteroids, Bullets) from Daniel Shiffman's video on this game, I went a step further by adding:

- A restart prompt - for when the player wins or loses the ship holds its position and the restart prompt shows until game's restarted.

- An objective & bullet counter - to keep track of asteroids and bullets remaining.

- A theme selector(light/dark mode) - for better usability in different environments.
